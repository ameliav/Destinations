# Destinations Project

This is a python based Jupyter Notebook project. The libraries used include pandas, re, csv, requests, bs4, webbrowser, and sys.

Most of the project includes manipulating data and merging it together to create a large and clean dataframe. There is some reformatting done and also web scraping for image urls.
The final dataset was used to create a public Tableau dashboard.
